1) I was struggling with the concept of adding images. I was also struggling with the concept of git fetch and git merge. 

2) Both of these concepts were clarified during my session. I can add the image by saving the folder with the user interface into the sublime. Git fetch and git merge are similar to git pull but they allow for extra steps in checking what you are about to put in your local repo. 

3) The questions I asked had to do with the above statements on adding images and git fetch and git merge. 

4) I am pretty confident in my abilites on git. 

5) It was good. It added clarifaction. It also assured me that I am doing an alright job.
